Sudoku Solver - experimenting with Atom

Nothing fancy, just a sudoku solver based on the tutorial by [ComputerPhile](#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM).

Instead of just printing a value, it returns it, so it can be incorporated into other code.

Will be working on an input function that will allow quick entry of any puzzle.
