Sudoku Solver - experimenting with Atom

Nothing fancy, just a sudoku solver based on the tutorial by [ComputerPhile](#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM). Built test first using unittest. As a result, instead of just printing a value, it returns it - it can therefore be incorporated into other code.

Will be working on an input function that will allow quick entry of any puzzle.

A nice interface showing the puzzle being solved would be good to look into - tutorials exist for this.
